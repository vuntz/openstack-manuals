            version which is 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), via the

    <para>We are going to install a three-node setup with one
        controller, one network and one compute node.</para>
    <para>Of course, you can setup as many computes nodes as you want. 
        Use this document to learn to install a testing infrastructure.</para> 
    <para>The OpenStack configuration files contain several commented
        options. These options specify the default setting. You only
        need to uncomment these lines if you are changing the setting
        to a non-default value. Additionally, the only options that
        will be shown throughout this guide are options that are being
        modified from their default value. </para>   
    <para>Finally, please be aware that the use of <literal>password</literal> 
        as a password throughout this guide is for simplicity and
        testing purposes. Please ensure you use proper passwords when 
        configuring your OpenStack environment in production.
